# Lab 2: Todo List

Let's make a simple todo-list which supports the following operations:

- add an item to the list
- remove an item from the list
- mark an item as completed

Removed items should disappear entirely. Completed items should appear at the bottom (or in a separate list) with a line through them. Use vanilla JS to select and manipulate the DOM elements. No jQuery.

Redo the assignment using jQuery. Yes, it's repetitive and annoying, but redoing the assignment *instead* of simply refactoring it, will help solidify DOM manipulation concepts in your head. You can also use this excercise to compare and contrast manipulating these two DOM manipulation techniques. Depending on your capstone, you'll likely need to use JS or jQuery to manipulate DOM elements and having a tool you like and are familiar with will be a big help.
