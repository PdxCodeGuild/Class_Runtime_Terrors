# Lab 10: Any API


Choose any API and write a page to interact with it. Be warned: some have particular security restrictions, and some return results in XML (which makes data more difficult to parse). You can view long lists of public APIs [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis), [here](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs), and [here](https://apilist.fun/).

## User API

There are several APIs to get fake user data which can be used to develop and test front-ends. Show a list of users with their attributes. You may also add a user detail page and pagination.
