# ParcelScan
### Project Overview
ParcelScan is a web application that scrapes parcel data from county databases and provides the user with targeted visualisations.
#### Possible applications include:
- **Fraud detection:**  Identifying mortgage and real estate fraud requires the observence of market price manipulation.  Filtering pricing data could provide visual alerts to governing agencies for further investigation.  ParcelScan aims to highlight anomalies within the county's real property valuations and sales based on the surrounding parcels.  A choropleth map could be used to enhance human visual pattern recognition for future filtering functinality.  
- **property Tax forclosure Prioritization:**  Currently, throughout the US, counties with high tax delinquency have implimented a [Depositor Foreclosure] (https://www.mcohio.org/government/elected_officials/treasurer/tax_payer_services/depositor_foreclosure.php) program. While simultaneuosly allowing the county to allocate human resources to meet the demand of it's residents and finance the cost of forclosure, the program neglects the costs to the tax payer for such limited enforcement of the tax code.  ParcelScan aims to highlight those delinquencies with a higher likelyhood of returning to the tax role by creating ratios of outstanding taxes to valuations.  A choropleth map of the ratio could help the county target those parcels with higher ratios within areas of generally lower.
