# Capstone Proposal

For my Capstone I will be attempting to improve the user experience of my 
favorite dispensaries website.

[Your CannaSource](http://yourcannasource.com)

## Name

I will call the project YourCannaSource 2.0


## Project Overview

I've decided to take on this task in order to learn more about website construction, as well as improving a website I currently use.
YourCannaSource 2.0 will add user accounts to the website, as well as 
adding the ability to pre-order online. As users orders are filled, the 
availability of a given product will be adjusted to reflect exactly what 
is in the physical store. Employees will also have access to the site in order to add/remove products. I will attempt to implement timers for specials, so as to drive sales. Ideally, I would like the program to track what users purchase and build databases of user interaction as a means of providing targeted advertising.
As it currently sits, the website is incomplete and offers no user interaction. I will implement the changes I see as necassary to provide meaningful user interaction.
I do not yet know what libraries or frameworks will be used.

## Functionality

When a user first lands on the websites home page, they will be shown current products, as well as any current deals going on, plus contact info such as phone number and a map to show the location. From this page a user will be able to navigate to the website 'menu' to view what is in store. If a user would like to pre-order online, an account will need to be set-up. Once the user is verified, they will be able to place online orders, and see any targeted promotions for them.
On the 'menu' page, users will be presented with all available products. Users will be able to filter shown results (Indica, Sativa, Concentrates, etc)
If the user clicks on a product, they will be photos of the product, as well as availability and pricing options.
If logged in, the user will be taken to their 'homepage', which will have specials, saved products, and a section to review products.
If a user places an online order, they will be taken to a page to finalize the order. Finalization will include reviewing the order, verifying the price, have an option to use a promo code, and selecting a time window that they would like to pick up the order at.
After an order is confirmed by an employee and the user picks up the order, the site will update the revised availability of products in the main site.

## Data Model

The website will have to store pictures of the products. User data such as ID(?), previous purchases, and reviews on products.

## Schedule

The first week, I will work on copying the reproducing the site as it currently displays. 
The second week, I will begin building the database to store user account information.
The third week, I will work on adding pages to display reviews.
The final week, I will review and test the website overall.
