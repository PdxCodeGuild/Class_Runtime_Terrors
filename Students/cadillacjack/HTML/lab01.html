    <h1>Hunter Stockton Thompson
        <br>
        July 18, 1937 - February 20, 2005
    </h1>
    <p> Hunter S. Thompson is a hero of mine. A man of action.
        <br>
        Not only was he an exceptional jounalist, Hunter was also a politician,
        <br>
        as well as an advocate for the use of entheogenic therapies.
        <br>
        "Too weird to live and too rare to die", Hunter was in a class of his own.
        <br>
        When Hunter didn't like what he saw happening in American politics,
        <br>
        he took decisive action and ran for sheriff of Pitken county, Colorado in 1970.
        <br>
        Hunter ran under the slogan of "Freak Power".
        <br>
        The phrase was coined from the mayoral campaign of Joe Edwards in Aspen, Colorado the year before,
        <br>
        which Hunter had written an aricle about in "Rolling Stone".
        <br>
        Hunter is perhaps best known for his "Gonzo journalism" movement.
        <br>
        Gonzo journalism is the method of venturing into the worlds in which you report,
        <br>
        and often participating in the activities of those on whom you're reporting.
        <br>
        Like everything Hunter did, his reporting was fully immersive.

        This is not an exhaustive list of Hunters' work. Hunter wrote extensively for several decades,
        <br>
        which landed him the spotlight in counter-culture for many years.
        <br>
        Few names are as well recognized as Hunter S. Thompson. 
        <br>
        Timothy Leary and Paul Staments are among Hunters' counter-culture peers.
        <br>
        <br>
        My favorite quote from Hunter is from
        <br>
        <a class="amazon" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Loathing-Las-Vegas-American/dp/B00SLU76OE/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/143-8078736-3447867?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00SLU76OE&pd_rd_r=7914d2c4-9217-44d1-aff2-6b62bb7613a8&pd_rd_w=1TpQh&pd_rd_wg=j7PQH&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=EHEK88NB9VPPS6YDPMDF&psc=1&refRID=EHEK88NB9VPPS6YDPMDF">"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"</a>

        This is what Hunter had to say in reference to his attorney, Oscar Zeta Acosta:
    </h2>
    <h1 class="quote">
        One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die."
