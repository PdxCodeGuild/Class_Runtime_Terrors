    <h1>Oscar, the Rose of Versaille</h1>
    <h3>A Lady-Fencer in the Court of Marie-Antoinette</h3>
    <p>Oscar is the fifth daughter of a Count who is determined to have at 
        least one son.  On hearing that his child will be a girl, he goes
        a little crazy and declares that she is a boy. He names her Oscar
        and raises her as a son, keeping her true gender a secret. 
        At the age of 14, Oscar wins her first duel to become a junior
        Commander of the Royal Guards... but even though she has made 
        her fatherproud, she begins to feel the pain of having to 
        deny her own
        femininity. Her first military assignment is to escort 
        Marie-Antoinette to the French Court.  Marie is about her own age.
        They soon become friends, each envying the other.
