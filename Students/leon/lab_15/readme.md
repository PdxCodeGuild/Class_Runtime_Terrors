# Count Words
## Lab 15
### leon

In this lab, we import a *text_file* into python compiler, and follow these steps: 
1. reduce all text lowercase
2. eliminate all punctuation
3. pull all of the remaining text into list elements

Once that is done, we build a dictionary for each unique element ('word') and count how many times each element appears in the list. 

Finally, we will print out the top 10 elements found in the list.
