    <h2>Nikola Tesla: 10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and
      physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical
      experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
      Edison in the new electric power industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a
      naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine
      Works in New York City before he struck out on his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set
      up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of
      electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC)
      induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
      Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of
      money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that
      company eventually marketed.

    <p>
      Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
      conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators,
      electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built
      a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla
      became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to
      celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
      showmanship at public lectures. 
      <br>
      Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric
      power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments
      in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the
      possibility of wireless communication with his devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished
      Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication
      and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete
      it. After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions
      in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having
      spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels,
      leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January
      1943.<br>
      Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until
      1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI
      unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. 
      There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
