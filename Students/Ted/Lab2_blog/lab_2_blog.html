            <p>You may be wondering what I will write next, or if I think I am funny. 
                You were probably not thinking about cabbage, until now.

            <li> Have you ever wondered 'what the fuck is wrong with people?'
            </li> 
            <li>Our 'source code' was written by evolution over the course of
                millions of years to allow us to survive in nature.
            </li> 
            <li>Things changed exponentialy when we caught fire.
            </li>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class= 'container3'>
            <li>The evolutionary source code demands that I survive, make and protect 
                my babies, then my siblings and their babies, then cousins,...
                With agriculture and promiscuity, everyone in a town was genetically related
                so we will feel protective of our community, and race.
            </li> 
            <li>As a balance to inbreeding, we have an urge to have mate with exotic people we meet,
                and to travel for that purpose. Xenophilia is also evolutionary.
            </li>
            <li>Priming is derived from pattern recognition and used by politicians to condition us
                 to be fearful of 'aliens' before telling us to bomb
                  or imprison them

            <p>Oxford Dictionary defines metacognition as; "awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes."
                Why do we teach field hocky instead of this to every grade in school?
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id= 'uses'>
            <p>Like opening a developer window to inspect the page you are presenting,
                    looking at your meta-cognition can, if you learn how to read it,
                    show you the programs you are runnng underneath your opinions.

        <br>
        <div id= 'disuses'>
            <p>'Just do it!' is a great example of priming the population to stop looking
                at their thinking. 'Trust your gut' and 'Own your truth' justify the act of
                believing whatever you think. This is a underpinning of disguarding science, 
                and ignoring, with prejudice, any opposing perspective.

        <div id= 'inhibitors'>
            <p>Speeking against the mob has always been dangerous. Evolution has favored 
                the silent by survival. When the people who invest their love in you tell
                you not to scream 'BULLSHIT!' whenever you smell it, they are protecting 
                their genome. And you internalize that advice for the same reason.
