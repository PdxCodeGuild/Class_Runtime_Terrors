        <h1>The Church of Logic</h1>
        <h3>A place where people with difficult questions can come to find real answers.</h3>
        <p>Humans are thin-skinned, clawless, fangless, slow to mature, and taste like pork.
            How did we survive? Our evolutionary ace was not flight or cameleon skin. We developed
            imagination to anticipate and mitigate danger. Imagine what a lion attack is like and what
            we would do with a sharp stick or club if it did. Visualization and invention was why
            we took the leftover forest fire branches into our cave to keep us warm, and used analogy to
            our hunger, to feed the fire what it liked to eat.
        </p>
        <p>Storms, earthquakes, diseases, were too far outside our ability to comprehend. For a species 
            dependent of knowing the dangers to avoid them, this presented a existential threat. We could-
            not rest until we had some way to cope with these, so we invented God, and magic, deamons, djinn,
            curses, dragons et. al. so we could sacrifice to them, avoid angering them, wear amulets to protect
            us from them. After the ritual, we felt safer, we could rest, and hunt, and make children.
        </p>
        <p>These inventions are no longer needed. The state of science has answered most of the primative questions
            we had. Unprovable and un-disprovable traditional answers block serious consideration of reality.
        </p>
        <p>Our objective is to provide the best logical analysis to any problem presented.</p>
