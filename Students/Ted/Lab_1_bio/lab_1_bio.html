    <p>Informed by the other scientists of his time, Darwin looked for consistancy among those ideas that seemed to have merit.</p>

    <blockquote cite=Darwin autobiography 1956 p.120>In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry,
     I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence
      which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, 
      it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, 
      and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. 
      Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work...(from Darwin's autobiography 1956 p.120)</blockquote>
