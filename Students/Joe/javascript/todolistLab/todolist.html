    <!-- figure out how to style so when you remove the task it wisks away gracefully. remember that the remove option is for if you no longer have to do that item, but when 
    cross it out it means you completed it. So, you still need to figure out how to move the crossed out items to a different part of DOM and figure out a way to have it disappear 
  after a certain amount of time if possible. Also move the items you add to the list on the left side and move the completed items to the right side and see if you can add dates 
of completion and add an option to move it back to the in-progress side.-->
