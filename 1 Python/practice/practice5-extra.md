## Problem 1: Pretty Numbers

Convert an integer into a pretty string with commas `12345678` to `12,345,678`

```python
def pretty_number(num):
    ...
print(pretty_number(12345678)) # 12,345,678
```

## Problem 2: Pretty Bytes

Convert a number of bytes `1567123` into a pretty form `1.5 mb`. The `round` function can take two parameters, the number and the number of decimal places to round to `print(round(1.2345, 2))` will print `1.23`.

```python
def pretty_bytes(bytes):
    ...
print(pretty_bytes(200)) # 200 b
print(pretty_bytes(1567123)) # 1.5 mb
print(pretty_bytes(7321000000)) # 7.32 gb 
```

## Problem 3: Palindrome

A palindrome is a word that's the same forwards or backwards, e.g. racecar. Another way to think of it is as a word that's equal to its own reverse. Write a function `check_palindrome(word)` which takes a string, and returns True if the string's a palindrome, or False if it's not.


```python
def check_palindrome(word):
    ...
print(check_palindrome('racecar')) # True
print(check_palindrome('palindrome')) # False
```

## Problem 4: Anagram

Two words are anagrams of eachother if the letters of one can be rearranged to fit the other. e.g. `anagram` and `nag a ram`. Write another function `check_anagram(word1, word2)` that takes two strings as parameters and returns True if they're anagrams of eachother, False if they're not. The procedure for comparing the two strings is as follow:

1. Convert each word to lower case (`lower`)
2. Remove all the spaces from each word (`replace`)
3. Sort the letters of each word (`sorted`)
4. Check if the two are equal

```python
def check_anagram(word1, word2):
    ...
print(check_anagram('anagram', 'nag a ram')) # True
print(check_anagram('sheep', 'goat')) # False
```


## Problem 5: Scramble Letters

Write a function `scramble_letters` to scramble the internals letters of words, but keep first and last letter the same.

```python
def scramble_letters(text):
    ...
print(scramble_letters('hello world!')) # hlelo wlrod!
```

## Problem 6

Write a function `cart_total` to calculate the total of a shopping cart.

```python
def cart_total(prices, cart):
    ...
prices = {'apples': 1.0, 'bananas': 0.5, 'kiwis': 2.0}
cart = [{'item': 'apples', 'quantity': 3}, {'item': 'kiwis', 'quantity': 4}]
print(cart_total(prices, cart)) # 11.0
```
