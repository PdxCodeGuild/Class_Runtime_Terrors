## The Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC)


An analogy might be writing an essay. We begin with researching a topic, write an outline, fill in the outline, run spell-check, email it to the professor, and make changes they suggest.


| step | description |
| ---  | ---         |
| requirements gathering | discussions with the client or stakeholder, researching the problem context, consider using existing solutions |
| design, planning | use cases, mockups, infrastructure (servers, databases, APIs, etc), major components of code, database design |
| implementation | actual coding |
| testing | unit testing, integration testing |
| deployment | configuring a server, DNS records, security |
| maintenance | debugging, adding extensions |

You can think of the SDLC generally following the following stages. Going through the stages in individually is called the 'waterfall model'. Agile and Scrum go through this cycle on shorter timelines. If your requirements are static and well-defined, waterfall is advantageous because there's a direct path of development and we can minimize overhead. However if your requirements might change or your client is capricious, agile approaches are more effective because they're adaptive.
