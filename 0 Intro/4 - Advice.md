Remember that nobody is perfect, especially when you're starting something new. Focus more on learning from your mistakes than internalizing the idea you're not "meant" to be a programmer.

Always ask questions if you don't understand something or if you're stuck. Ask a neighbor, ask a TA, or ask an instructor.

To stay relevant, you'll have to be continually learning new languages and frameworks throughout your professional career. Adopt a growth mentality and be open to learning from an early stage.



When faced with a new problem:
- consider the various tools at your disposal, what we've learned so far
- break a big problem into more manageable chunks
- write each step you'll take to solve the problem in comments

When you get an error:
- read the error message carefully
- look at where in the code it points to
- google the error message if it's specific

When you get stuck:
- take a step back, re-evaluate the problem context
- look at previous labs
- look at the class docs, python docs, mdn, django docs
- look for similar examples on stack overflow
- try extracting bits of code and running them in isolation
- ask a fellow student, TA, or instructor

Avoid getting burnt-out:
- take regular breaks
- don't try randomly changing values or syntax
- don't haphazardly copy-paste code from stack overflow
