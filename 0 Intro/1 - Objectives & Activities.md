## Activities

This course is a sling-shot into a professional software development career, it is immersive and pragmatic. We focus on understanding the principles in practice. Most of the class will consist of alternating between lectures, demos, and labs. While we're working on our labs, you're free to use the entirety of the space.

The class will use a repo for viewing docs, labs, and solutions. This is also where you will submit your own solutions, in a folder with your name.

Occasionally we'll have one-on-one sessions so that I (the instructor) can ensure that each student is on-track with the material.

Tutoring outside of class is free and can be scheduled with the instructor.

### Lectures & Demonstrations

The purpose of lectures is to introduce and explain a topic. Most lectures are followed by live demonstrations. Please do not speak or distract yourself during lecture.

### Labs

Labs represent the bulk of the course work. Read the lab description, plan out a solution, and implement your solution in a `.py` file. Please label your solutions very clearly (lab01.py, lab02.py) and split the different versions into different files (unless the advanced version is a direct extension of the last solution).

Lab solutions must perform the function described in the lab description. Unless an advanced version of a lab is labeled 'optional', it's not optional. All assignments must be formatted, tested, and commented in order to be considered 'complete'. All assignments must be completed in order to complete the course.

Many labs will have optional versions, which include additional features you can complete if you have the time or the desire, and may require you to do additional research. Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version of the assignment. Advanced requirements will enable you to reach into the more advanced topics of the course, and will give you a deeper understanding of the language.

These labs are designed to build upon each other, and so are best completed in order. The purpose of these labs is to practice your ability to break down a problem and express solutions in code. 

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after 15 minutes of review and research, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input. I'll review your solutions from time to time and verify that they successfully fit the requirements of the assignment. If they don't, you'll need to fix them.

Once you've finished a lab, or a major portion of a lab, commit and push your work. Unless you have a good reason (building's on fire), try to only commit working code.

##### Academic Honesty

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself. You're only inhibiting your own learning by doing so.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works. If you're not sure, look up the function in the docs, try running it with a variety of inputs, and try tweaking the syntax, throw in print statements to print the values of variables at different times, etc. You also cannot use a single function which performs the entirety of the solution for you. The early labs are designed to practice string and list operations, using a function that does it all defeats the purpose.

I hope this clearly defines the line between academic honesty and academic dishonesty.


### Pair, Group, & Mob Programming

Occasionally we'll do [pair or group programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) for a lab. Ensure that neither of you is in control of the keyboard for the majority of the time. Regularly alternate roles between directing (talking about what needs to be done) and driving (actually typing).

For [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), one student will type while others discuss and decide on what to type. It is not the typists' responsibility to figure out what to write, that is the responsibility of the mob.


### Student Presentations

At the end of the Python and JavaScript sections, you'll give a presentation on an assignment of your choice. This is practice for your capstone presentation which you'll give on the last day of class.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

In all three presentations, you should first explain the development process and the different parts of your code. Then run the application and show its features and interaction (entering data, seeing results, etc). Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

- what problem your application solve? what is the core function it performs?
- how did you go about planning?
- what major issues did you encounter during the course of development? how did you go about overcoming them?
- how did your vision for the project change over time?
- what part did you like the most? least?
- what is the future of the project? what features (if any) will you work on next?
